## 🌐 Vercel Deployment

If you're only interested in seeing what the application looks like and how it behaves, you can find it online at: **[your-vercel-url]**

## 🛠️ Play Locally With The Code

Clone the repo and configure your `.env` file using the provided `.env.example`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gameland.git
cd gameland
cp .env.example .env
```

### 🔐 Environment Variables

You’ll need to fill in your `.env` file with valid values. Here’s what each variable does:

- `DATABASE_URL` – PostgreSQL connection string (e.g. `postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/gameland`)
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DB` – Used to initialize the PostgreSQL container
- `GMAIL_USER`, `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` – Used by Nodemailer to send contact form emails. It's optional if you don't use the contact form.
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` – Cryptographic key for session tokens (generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`)
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` – Base URL of your app (e.g. `http://localhost:3000` for local dev)

Use the `.env.example` file as a template and **never commit** your actual `.env` to version control.

### ⚡ Quick Setup with Docker

For a quick local setup using [Docker/docker-compose](https://www.docker.com/), run the following. The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 💻 Full Dev Experience (Hot Reload)

For a full development workflow:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the development server

Changes will reflect instantly in your browser.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
